1. With the wide application of location-based social networks (LBSNs), point-of-interest (POI) recommendation has become one of the major services in LBSNs. 
2. This project selects the list of POIs with the greatest influence for recommending users. 
3. Recommendation techniques such as content based, collaborative and hybrid filtering are studied. 
4. Location factor is considered as connective element between item and user in recommendation systems.
5. At last, this project conducts a comprehensive performance evaluation using two real LBSN datasets. 

This project developed a recommender system using collaborative filtering techniques (User-Based, Item-Based, and SVD) to predict location preferences from user check-in data. Key achievements include:
Accuracy: Achieved RMSE of 0.96 (SVD), 0.97 (User-Based), and 0.98 (Item-Based).
Precision & Recall: For top-N recommendations (N=5, 10, 15, 20), SVD consistently outperformed with higher average precision and recall scores.
Efficiency: Processed 82,428 rows of data (with 99.4% sparsity) and generated insights using scalable matrix operations.
Visual Analysis: Included RMSE comparison, precision-recall curves, and performance metrics at varying recommendation levels (N).
This system effectively demonstrates the impact of collaborative filtering for location-based recommendations.
